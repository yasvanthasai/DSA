Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This collection includes solutions to various well-known problems, organized by topic. The primary goal of this repo is to deepen my understanding of fundamental concepts while exploring different approaches and optimizations.

Repository Structure:

1. Arrays DSA
Contains essential array-based problems, including searching, sorting, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.

2. Bit Manipulation
Showcases problems that use bitwise operations to achieve efficient solutions, such as XOR-based checks and mask-based computations.

3. Blind75
A curated list of 75 must-solve problems covering arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. This section is a go-to for interview preparation.

4. Practice Problems
A variety of additional DSA exercises spanning different topics and difficulty levels. Great for daily practice and keeping problem-solving skills sharp.

Getting Started:

Language: Most solutions are in Java, though other languages may appear if theyâ€™re better suited for a specific problem.

Usage: Feel free to clone or fork this repository. Each folder contains its own set of problem statements and solutions.

Contributions: Suggestions, optimizations, and additional solutions are always welcome. Create a pull request or open an issue to discuss your ideas.
