/*Given an integer A.
Two numbers, X and Y, are defined as follows:

X is the greatest number smaller than A such that the XOR sum of X and A is the same as the sum of X and A.
Y is the smallest number greater than A, such that the XOR sum of Y and A is the same as the sum of Y and A.
Find and return the XOR of X and Y.

NOTE 1: XOR of X and Y is defined as X ^ Y where '^' is the BITWISE XOR operator.

NOTE 2: Your code will be run against a maximum of 100000 Test Cases. */
